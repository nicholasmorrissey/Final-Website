Front End Web Design CSS Rationale - Nicholas Morrissey u3160673

My development process initially involved thinking about what I found appealing and comfortable about websites that I visit and use. My first main decision was to center the content in a main column, this reduces the amount your eyes have to travel around the page and makes it a cleaner and tighter design. The title was also centered above the center column and given a different colour and background colour to make it pop out more. For the content, the locations of Norfolk Island, I wanted to do something a little different than just list them sequentially. The first thing I did was to align the text and location title next to the image, this associates the image with the text more and makes much better use of real estate on the page. To break up the monotony of the locations being listed one after the other sequentially, I decided to alternate their alignment to the left and right of the center column. This helps to keep your flow through the page more interesting and add some individualism to the locations. This also involved aligning the text and titles of the locations to match the images. For the colour scheme I intitially went with a range of greys but decided it was a bit too dull and boring. I then experimented with different colours and settled on a dark red. I found that it was a subtle colour that wasn't obnoxious and distracting from the content. It also has a vintage and historical quality to it which adds to the nature of the content. For the font I settled on Helvetica, I found it was a familiar, clean, and approachable but official font that is readily available. 

As per the requirements for this assignment I didn't add any functionality for navigation or multiple pages, however that would have impacted the design if it was a requirement.
